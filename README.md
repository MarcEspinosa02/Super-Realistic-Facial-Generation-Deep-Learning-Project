# Super-Realistic-Facial-Generation-Deep-Learning-Project
This is our project for deep learning, with the objective to achieve Super-Realistic Facial Generation
We have two main archives, one to show how Wasserstein Gan DIV functions and an other to show how it does the standard GAN. We can see both in this project.
**It might be necessary to change some directions where the programs make a reference to a instance of a google drive folder and to download a zip file with an img database (like Celeba)**
